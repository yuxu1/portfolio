                    <h1>Yufan Xu<br>Web Developer</h1>
                    <p>
                        I am a full stack web developer with a focus on frontend development. To pursue a 
                        previously unexplored interest in coding, I completed Career Foundry's Full Stack Web 
                        Development program, where I learned through hands-on projects the fundamentals of 
                        <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>NoSQL</strong>, related 
                        frameworks and libraries like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, 
                        <strong>Django</strong>, and more.
                        <br>
                        I am based in San Francisco, CA and seeking opportunities to further develop my coding skills in the area or open to remote as well. 
                        If you have an opportunity for me, or are interested in connecting, please feel free to reach out! I look forward to speaking with you!

                            I was born in the city of Taishan in China's Guangdong province, but I grew up in 
                            San Francisco after my family immigrated here when I was two years old. For me 
                            San Francisco is home, and I love its diverse people and beautiful parks, so I 
                            have returned to the city after college. <br>
                            I studied Business Administration with concentrations in Management and 
                            Supply Chain & Operations Management at Northeastern University in Boston. I then went 
                            on to pursue a business career that led me through a wide range of industries and 
                            work environments. My curiosity and eagerness to keep learning has brought me to 
                            make a big decision in my career - to switch paths and enter the field of tech.

                            The first exposure I had to coding was in a computer programming class back 
                            at Lowell High School. The memory is hazy now, but I remember working on  
                            programming tasks, including coding the functions of a dice and recreating games 
                            like Minesweeper and Asteroids. I remember it as an intriguing class with its 
                            annoying bits of debugging, but at the time I did not see it as a career choice ...
                            but things change. <br>
                            After exploring the field of business for several years, the thought of doing something 
                            different crossed my mind more and more often. I realized that I was better suited to 
                            work behind the scenes, especially behind a computer. I came across the Web Development 
                            program with Career Foundry and took the chance by registering, and I am glad I did. I 
                            I find peace in solving puzzles, and there are many puzzles we encounter in coding and web 
                            development. Although it became frustrating at times, it would be rewarding when it is finally 
                            resolved. I enjoy building things and see the direct results of my work, which is why 
                            after getting exposed to both the front and back end services, I am seeking to focus on the 
                            front end, at least in the beginning of my new career.

                        <p>
                            Outside of work, I enjoy solving puzzles (all kinds, but particularly jigsaw, word, 
                            and number puzzles), hiking, bouldering, and listening to music. For relaxation I especially enjoy 
                            hikes with gorgeous views of mountains or bodies of water (fun fact:this helped inspire the AI-generated design of the 
                            favicon and logo I used in this portfolio).<br>
                            I also love traveling and desire to do more of it, and relatedly I find it fascinating to learn 
                            about different cultures and languages. Maybe part of the reason why I am interested in coding is because 
                            it is like learning a new language (multiple different languages actually), and there are many problems (think puzzles) 
                            waiting to be solved. As someone with a strong growth mindset, I am excited by the fact that there will always be more 
                            for me to learn in this field no matter how experienced I become.
